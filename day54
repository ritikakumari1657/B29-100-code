Q104: Write a Program to take a positive integer n as input, and find the pivot integer x such that the sum of all elements between 1 and x inclusively equals the sum of all elements
between x and n inclusively.Print the pivot integer x. If no such integer exists, print -1. Assume that it is guaranteed that there will be at most one pivot integer for the given input.


#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
int main() {
    int n;
    printf("Enter a positive integer n: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    long long total_sum_1_to_n = (long long)n * (n + 1) / 2;
    double x_double = sqrt(total_sum_1_to_n);
    int x_int = (int)x_double;
    if (x_int == x_double) { 
        printf("%d\n", x_int);
    } else {
        printf("-1\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
